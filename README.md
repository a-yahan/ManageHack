# Manage Hack  

## Why:  

### Problem Statement: What specific issue does your project solve?  
The day-of logistical operations of hackathons are often complex and hard to keep track of for board members with hundreds of participants. Manage Hack is a web application that aims to streamline and simplify this process by integrating check-in records, point-tracking systems, and other information in one place for event hosts and participants and providing secure tracking methodologies to enforce integrity.  

### Objectives: List measurable goals (e.g., "Build a chatbot that answers FAQs with 90% accuracy").  
- **Token-Based User Authentication**: Authenticate users to secure user data, and differentiate participants and hosts.  

### Features:  
- Check-in status  
- Meal collection status  
- Participant info: overnight accommodation requirements, reimbursement needs…etc.  
- Points tracking for merch and special snacks (boba)  
- Team info/team matching  
- Public announcements  
- **Host**: Create Events and Publish Events  
- **Participants**: Find teammates? Join events  

### Impact: Why does this matter to users?  
- Increase effectiveness and organization.  

## What:  

### Scope: Define what your project is and isn’t.  
- **IS**: Tracking/Event management system.  
- **NOT**: Communication tools like Discord.  

### Personas: Describe your target users (e.g., students, professionals).  
- Students host organizations that organize and run hackathons  
- Students and people who participate in hackathons.  

### User Stories: Outline scenarios like "As a [Persona], I want to [action], so [reason]"  
- As a **Manage Hack Host** user, I want to open the web app and have intuitive and easy-to-follow UIs that will guide me in using and creating a project to manage my event.  
- As a **Manage Hack Participant** user, I want to open the web app and have an intuitive UI that will guide me to the right places and join the event I want to attend as well as manage my information.  

## How:

- React + token-based authentication JWT + AWS hosting, MySQL (some relational database) + Python + ???? Express.js (YES)  

### Wireframes: Sketch UI layouts (use Figma Pro!).  

### Architecture: Plan backend structure (APIs, databases).
